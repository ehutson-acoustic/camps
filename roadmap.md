# Roadmap

## Known defects


* You have to click outside the calendar when selecting a date to get the calendar popup to close.
* When refreshing the engineer details page, the tab reverts to the CAMPS Ratings instead of staying on the last tab.
* ~~Getting the latest CAMPS Ratings from the server is not working reliably.  It is using the rating_date which is only a date instead of using the created_at which is a datetime.~~
* ~~When completing an action, the outcome and completion date are not saved in the database.~~* 



## New features

* Add teams CRUD.
* Add engineers CRUD.
* Add authentication and authorization.
* It would be nice for the main content to be a single-page application (SPA) instead of having to reload the page when switching between teams.
* Add a teams dashboard that we navigate to when selecting a team.
